# seqan3-doc

This repostitory contains scripts and files for generating api documenation automatically.

* Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
* Breathe: https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe
* Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/
* ReadTheDocs: https://readthedocs.org/

1. Github send a signal to ReadTheDocs when seqan3 repository has a update.
2. ReadTheDocs clone the SeqAn3 repository and run Doxygen.
3. ReadTheDocs generate .rst files using Breathe from .xml files generated by Doxygen.
4. ReadTheDocs generate .html files using Sphinx from .rst files.
5. ReadTheDocs serves the documentation pages. 

By using this system, the core team will be freed by maintaining in-house documentation system and a lot of html / javascript works.
